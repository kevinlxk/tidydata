Tidy Data Course Project
========

Course Project repo for the Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Course

This repo contains a CodeBook.md containing information on the tidy data set uploaded on the course project submission page; and the additional file run_analysis.R is used to treat the raw data for generating the tidy data set.

As contained in the comments of the R script, any users using the script is expected to download the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip it, placing the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder in the working directory of R then renaming the folder to 'dataset' before proceeding to run the script.

Note also that running the script automatically generates 2 .txt data files: "tidydata_step4.txt" and "tidydata_step5.txt".

These data files contains the data set requested in step 4 and 5 of the course project requirements respectively.
