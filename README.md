Tidy Data Course Project
========

Course Project repo for the Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Course

This repo contains a CodeBook.md containing information on the tidy data set uploaded on the course project submission page; and the additional file run_analysis.R is used to treat the raw data for generating the tidy data set.

The script would automatically download and process the relevant data from the UCI HAR Dataset. As the download link for the file is from the Coursera website, we can be sure that this is the dataset used solely for the purposes of this project.

Note also that running the script automatically generates 2 .txt data files: "tidydata_step4.txt" and "tidydata_step5.txt".

These data files contains the data set requested in step 4 and 5 of the course project requirements respectively.
